# TashTenHat

Raspberry Pi hat with I2C interface for X10 (and bonus UART).

## Technical Details

### Building Firmware

Building the firmware requires Microchip MPASM, which is included with their development environment, MPLAB. Note that you **must** use MPLAB X version 5.35 or earlier or MPLAB 8 as later versions of MPLAB X have removed MPASM.
